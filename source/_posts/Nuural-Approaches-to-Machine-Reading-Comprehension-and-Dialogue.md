## KBQA - question answering on Knowledge Base

### Large-scale knowledge graphs.

  * Properties of billionss of entities.
  * Plus relations among them.



## Symbolic approaches to QA: production systen

  * Production rules  
condition-action pairs  
Represent(world) knowledege as a graph.


  * Working memory  
Contains a description of the current state of the world in a reasoning process.

  * Recongnizer-act controller  
Update working memory by searching and firing a production rule.
